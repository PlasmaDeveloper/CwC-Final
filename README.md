# CwC-Final
Unity Junior Programmer Pathway, final assigment

This isnt finished, it is only a MVP/Prototype to fullfill the requirements of the final assigment from the Unity Junior Programmer Pathway.
Currently only the Chess Pice Controller, the Pawn and the Kings movement are working and also there is currently no option to capture a pice.
I already spend 5 days of my freetime working on this and I have other things to do - especially when you take notice, that only 30 minutes of 
work where sceduled for the final project from this Pathway.
